# Pyseer tutorial code that actually works

The [official Pyseer tutorials](https://pyseer.readthedocs.io/) appear to be somewhat lacking in quality control department. This project attempts to provide runnable R code that corresponds to those tutorials.

You will need Docker Desktop to run this code; you can install it [from the official Docker site](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

After installing Docker Desktop, open either `gwas.Rmd` or `prediction.Rmd` for the corresponding tutorial.
